<p>Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is &lt;your name here&gt;, and I am a &lt;designation&gt; at &lt;university name&gt;. You can add more details here, such as the most recent affiliation to a research group, etc.<br><br>

I maintain a list of my publications, research projects and implementations under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab, and a list of other non-research projects under the <a href="/projects">Projects</a> tab. You may also check out my <a href="">Github profile.</a><br><br>
