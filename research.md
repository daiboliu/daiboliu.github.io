**We have a broad horizon of research because students at NSSGroup are encouraged to bring up their thoughts of diversity and offered opportunity of scientific exploration. Here are some previous and ongoing projects.**

### Wireless Sensing
- *Sound analystics*: proposes to develop techniques and mobile systems that utilize sound to decribe current environment, such as FMCW signal to detect middle-ear effusion and sound-based dangerous driving alarm. We also pay attention to potential threats, such as click inference for touchscreen text input.
- *Biometric* : proposes a way to monitor cranial cavity activity with off-the-shelf earphone.

### Video Streaming
- *Extreme mobility scene*: discusses possible solutions to ensure video QoE for HSR passengers.
- *Video conference*: proposes a novel method with Human Face Synthesis to mitigate the impact network fluctuation during interactive video conference.

### Privacy Preserving
- *Vibration*: addresses security concerns brought by vibration signals, such as deep learning-aided audio eavesdropping.
- *EMR leakage*: proposes methods to exploit the broadcast nature of wireless signal. We worked on real-time EMR-based wireless camera detection.
